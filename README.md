This is a very alpha version of a script of a totally private use.
It parses a CSV file and generates a LyX document with a table.

Everything is fixed: The number of columns, the LyX version and the formatting
of the resulting table in the document.

One day the code in here may be generalized and put on CPAN.

This is Dist::Zilla-base.

To try it:

  dzil run perl scripts/birthday2lyx --file birthdays.csv
